FTC Chaos, 2024!

This repository contains the OnBot java snapshots. FTC's libs don't play nice with VS code, but they're friendly with android studio!

Options:

`-N` Non working snapshot

`-W` Working snapshot

`-T` Test version


Example: `2024-11-1-T`
_________

Version 0.1: Origional file naming system, `[MM]-[DD]-[YYYY]`; Assumes all snapshots work. (Untrue)

Version 1.0: Added `-W` and `-N` to determine working and non-working snapshots. Changed to `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]` for easy sorting.

Version 1.1: Added `-T` for test snapshots, which have yet to be proven. Likely made in android studio without the actual robot present.
